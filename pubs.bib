abstract = {Machine Ethics decisions should consider the implications of uncertainty over decisions. Decisions should be made over sequences of actions to reach preferable outcomes long term. The evaluation of outcomes, however, may invoke one or more moral theories, which might have conflicting judgements. Each theory will require differing representations of the ethical situation. For example, Utilitarianism measures numerical values, Deontology analyses duties, and Virtue Ethics emphasises moral character. While balancing potentially conflicting moral considerations, decisions may need to be made, for example, to achieve morally neutral goals with minimal costs. In this paper, we formalise the problem as a Multi-Moral Markov Decision Process and a Multi-Moral Stochastic Shortest Path Problem. We develop a heuristic algorithm based on Multi-Objective AO*, utilising Sven-Ove Hansson's Hypothetical Retrospection procedure for ethical reasoning under uncertainty. Our approach is validated by a case study from Machine Ethics literature: the problem of whether to steal insulin for someone who needs it.},

The study engaged 22 domain experts specializing in software, cybersecurity, and CNI, whose roles all include forecasting technological trends and challenges. The findings propose making Internet Services a CNI sector, and suggested the weightiest concern to be human-centric challenges around the recovery from software disasters and cyberattacks. Other major concerns also related to human factors, such as attacks via operators, and errors stemming from poorly designed human-computer interfaces. The suggested mitigation strategies therefore concentrate on human-centred approaches. Key recommendations include promoting human-focused cyber resilience, and using legislation, regulation and standards to help establish it in CNI organizations.}

abstract="[Context {\&} Motivation] Explainable autonomous systems are increasingly essential for engendering trust, especially when they are deployed in safety-critical scenarios. [Question/Problem] Despite the robust reliability needed in critical settings, there remains a gap between Explainable AI and Requirements Engineering (RE), raising the question: can current RE techniques sufficiently elicit explainability requirements and what characteristics do these requirements have? [Principal Ideas/Results] We examine whether established RE techniques can be used to elicit explainability requirements and analyse the characteristics of such requirements. We answer these questions in the context of a nuclear robotics case study focused on navigation and task scheduling missions. [Contribution] We contribute: (1) an experience report of eliciting explainability requirements, (2) categories for explainability requirements for explainable autonomous robotic systems and (3) practical guidance for applying our approach in other safety-critical domains.",

However, assessing the validity of explanations for NLI is challenging as it typically involves the crowd-sourcing of apposite datasets, a process that is time-consuming and prone to logical errors. To address existing limitations, this paper investigates the verification and refinement of natural language explanations through the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Theorem Provers (TPs). Specifically, we present a neuro-symbolic framework, named Explanation-Refiner, that integrates TPs with LLMs to generate and formalise explanatory sentences and suggest potential inference strategies for NLI. In turn, the TP is employed to provide formal guarantees on the logical validity of the explanations and to generate feedback for subsequent improvements. We demonstrate how Explanation-Refiner can be jointly used to evaluate explanatory reasoning, autoformalisation, and error correction mechanisms of state-of-the-art LLMs as well as to automatically enhance the quality of explanations of variable complexity in different domains.",

Despite their success, however, LLMs are still prone to factual errors and inconsistencies in their explanations, offering limited control and interpretability for inference in complex domains. In this paper, we focus on ethical NLI, investigating how hybrid neuro-symbolic techniques can enhance the logical validity and alignment of ethical explanations produced by LLMs. Specifically, we present an abductive-deductive framework named Logic-Explainer, which integrates LLMs with an external backward-chaining solver to refine step-wise natural language explanations and jointly verify their correctness, reduce incompleteness and minimise redundancy. An extensive empirical analysis demonstrates that Logic-Explainer can improve explanations generated via in-context learning methods and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) on challenging ethical NLI tasks, while, at the same time, producing formal proofs describing and supporting models{'} reasoning. As ethical NLI requires commonsense reasoning to identify underlying moral violations, our results suggest the effectiveness of neuro-symbolic methods for multi-step NLI more broadly, opening new opportunities to enhance the logical consistency, reliability, and alignment of LLMs.",

	abstract = {Ensuring digital privacy necessitates users giving well-considered consent to online service providers for data usage, creating an unsustainable and error-prone decision load. Software privacy agents can help make data consent decisions on behalf of users, but a compromised agent could be more detrimental than the absence of such an agent. In response, we employ trustworthy autonomous agents to safeguard users' privacy at the stage of data collection. Drawing upon General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) principles, notably data minimisation, our autonomous agent guarantees that GDPR-reflected privacy requirements are met through strong proof. We provide a computational encoding of a typical data collection scenario-where data are requested and decisions are made about these requests-as a cognitive agent that makes decisions based on how an agent's beliefs and goals lead to particular choices. Importantly, our approach provides verifiable assurance about decisions made by these cognitive agents through formal verification, supporting both simultaneous (data requested at the same time) and sequential (data requested one after the other) situations. We provide a templated implementation of these privacy agents and a small example of a mobile app serves to illustrate how a privacy agent can be designed in practice. An in-depth evaluation is given to demonstrate its computational practicality in making privacy decisions in real time and its computational complexity in verifying them. This approach represents a promising step towards trustworthy computational stewardship in data management.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems}, pages = {1966â€“1974}, numpages = {9}, keywords = {data collection, privacy, trustworthy autonomous agents}, location = {, Auckland, New Zealand, },

abstract="The need for AI systems to explain themselves is increasingly recognised as a priority, particularly in domains where incorrect decisions can result in harm and, in the worst cases, death. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) tries to produce human-understandable explanations for AI decisions. However, most XAI systems prioritize factors such as technical complexities and research-oriented goals over end-user needs, risking information overload. This research attempts to bridge a gap in current understanding and provide insights for assisting users in comprehending the rule-based system's reasoning through dialogue. The hypothesis is that employing dialogue as a mechanism can be effective in constructing explanations. A dialogue framework for rule-based AI systems is presented, allowing the system to explain its decisions by engaging in ``Why?'' and ``Why not?'' questions and answers. We establish formal properties of this framework and present a small user study with encouraging results that compares dialogue-based explanations with proof trees produced by the AI System.",

In particular it will look at the use of model-checking to verify the choices made by a cognitive agent in control of decision making within an autonomous system. It will consider the assumptions that need to be made about the environment in which the agent operates in order to perform that verification and how those assumptions can be validated via runtime monitoring. Lastly it will consider how compositional techniques can be used to combine the agent verification with verification of other components within the autonomous system.",

	abstract = {Autonomous systems are increasingly being used (or proposed for use) in situations where they are near or interact (physically or otherwise) with humans. They can be useful for performing tasks that are dirty or dangerous, or jobs that are simply distant or dull. This white paper sets out principles to consider when designing, developing, and regulating autonomous systems that are required to operate in hazardous environments. Autonomous systems use software to make decisions without the need for human control. They are often embedded in a robotic system, to enable interaction with the real world. This means that autonomous robotic systems are often safety-critical, where failures can cause human harm or death. For the sorts of autonomous robotic systems considered by this white paper, the risk of harm is likely to fall on human workers (the system’s users or operators). Autonomous systems also raise ssues of security and data privacy, both because of the sensitive data that the system might process and because a security failure can cause a safety failure. {\textless}strong{\textgreater}Scope{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} This white paper is intended to be an add-on to the relevant existing standards and guidance for (for example) robotics, electronic systems, control systems, and safety-critical software. These existing standards provide good practice for their respective areas, but do not provide guidance for autonomous systems. This white paper adds to the emerging good practice for developing autonomous robotic systems that are amenable to strong Verification \&amp; Validation. The intended audience of this white paper is developers of autonomous and robotic systems. It aims to provide a description of things that need to be demonstrable by or of their systems, and recommendations of ways to achieve this. This aims to enable strong Verification \&amp; Validation of the resulting autonomous system, and to mitigate some of the hazards already occurring in autonomous systems. {\textless}strong{\textgreater}Acknowledgments{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Our thanks go to Vince Page, and Xiaowei Huang for contributing their expert advice; and to our early reviewers: Xingyu Zhao, Başak Sarac̣ -Lesavre, and Nick Hawes for their invaluable discussion and comments.},

The scenario used in the contest is an extension of the previous edition (14th) ``Agents Assemble'' wherein two teams of agents move around a 2D grid and compete to assemble complex block structures. We discuss the languages and tools used during the development of our team. Then, we summarise the main strategies that were carried over from our previous participation in the 14th edition and list the limitations (if any) of using these strategies in the latest contest edition. We also developed new strategies that were made specifically for the extended scenario: cartography (determining the size of the map); formal verification of the map merging protocol (to provide assurances that it works when increasing the number of agents); plan cache (efficiently scaling the number of planners); task achievement (forming groups of agents to achieve tasks); and bullies (agents that focus on stopping agents from the opposing team). Finally, we give a brief overview of our performance in the contest and discuss what we believe were our shortcomings.",

Exploring the assumptions behind the technology in the series---what kind of actions it prohibits, and how it prohibits them---it then turns to current research in the field of computer science to examine how current models of ``model judges'' compare to Wells's fictional setting. In so doing, it seeks to consider how autonomy and agency are constrained by such technologies, and the problems involved in situating and programming such a system.",

ABSTRACT = {A drive to reduce costs, carbon emissions, and the number of required personnel in the offshore energy industry has led to proposals for the increased use of autonomous/robotic systems for many maintenance tasks. There are questions over how such missions can be shown to be safe. A corollary exists in the manned aviation world for helicopter–ship operations where a test pilot attempts to operate from a ship under a range of wind conditions and provides subjective feedback on the level of difficulty encountered. This defines the ship–helicopter operating limit envelope (SHOL). Due to the cost of creating a SHOL there has been considerable research activity to demonstrate that much of this process can be performed virtually. Unmanned vehicles, however, have no test pilot to provide feedback. This paper therefore explores the possibility of adapting manned simulation techniques to the unmanned world to demonstrate that a mission is safe. Through flight modelling and simulation techniques it is shown that operating envelopes can be created for an oil rig inspection task and that, by using variable performance specifications, these can be tailored to suit the level of acceptable risk. The operating envelopes produced provide condensed and intelligible information regarding the environmental conditions under which the UAS can perform the task.},

ABSTRACT = {Usually, the design of an Autonomous Vehicle (AV) does not take into account traffic rules and so the adoption of these rules can bring some challenges, e.g., how to come up with a Digital Highway Code which captures the proper behaviour of an AV against the traffic rules and at the same time minimises changes to the existing Highway Code? Here, we formally model and implement three Road Junction rules (from the UK Highway Code). We use timed automata to model the system and the MCAPL (Model Checking Agent Programming Language) framework to implement an agent and its environment. We also assess the behaviour of our agent according to the Road Junction rules using a double-level Model Checking technique, i.e., UPPAAL at the design level and AJPF (Agent Java PathFinder) at the development level. We have formally verified 30 properties (18 with UPPAAL and 12 with AJPF), where these properties describe the agent’s behaviour against the three Road Junction rules using a simulated traffic scenario, including artefacts like traffic signs and road users. In addition, our approach aims to extract the best from the double-level verification, i.e., using time constraints in UPPAAL timed automata to determine thresholds for the AVs actions and tracing the agent’s behaviour by using MCAPL, in a way that one can tell when and how a given Road Junction rule was selected by the agent. This work provides a proof-of-concept for the formal verification of AV behaviour with respect to traffic rules.},

	abstract="There have been many attempts to integrate automated planning and rational agents. Most of the research focuses on adding support directly within agent programming languages, such as those based on the Belief-Desire-Intention model, rather than using off-the-shelf planners. This approach is often believed to improve the computation time, which is a common requirement in real world applications. This paper shows that even in complex scenarios, such as in the Multi-Agent Programming Contest with 50 agents and a 4 s deadline for the agents to send actions to the server, it is possible to efficiently integrate agent languages with off-the-shelf automated planners. Based on the experience with this case study, the paper discusses advantages and disadvantages of decoupling the agents from the planners.",

In the paper, we outline the development and structure of the draft standard. We present the rationale for transparency as a measurable, testable property. We outline five stakeholder groups: users, the general public and bystanders, safety certification agencies, incident/accident investigators and lawyers/expert witnesses, and explain the thinking behind the normative definitions of “levels” of transparency for each stakeholder group in P7001. The paper illustrates the application of P7001 through worked examples of both specification and assessment of fictional autonomous systems.},

abstract = {The advent of sophisticated robotics and AI technology makes sending humans into hazardous and distant environments to carry out inspections increasingly avoidable. Being able to send a robot, rather than a human, into a nuclear facility or deep space is very appealing. However, building these robotic systems is just the start and we still need to carry out a range of verification and validation tasks to ensure that the systems to be deployed are as safe and reliable as possible. Based on our experience across three research and innovation hubs within the UK’s “Robots for a Safer World” programme, we present an overview of the relevant techniques and challenges in this area. As the hubs are active across nuclear, offshore, and space environments, this gives a breadth of issues common to many inspection robots.},

	abstract = {When applying formal verification to a system that interacts with the real world, we must use a model of the environment. This model represents an abstraction of the actual environment, so it is necessarily incomplete and hence presents an issue for system verification. If the actual environment matches the model, then the verification is correct; however, if the environment falls outside the abstraction captured by the model, then we cannot guarantee that the system is well behaved. A solution to this problem consists in exploiting the model of the environment used for statically verifying the system’s behaviour and, if the verification succeeds, using it also for validating the model against the real environment via runtime verification. The article discusses this approach and demonstrates its feasibility by presenting its implementation on top of a framework integrating the Agent Java PathFinder model checker. A high-level Domain Specific Language is used to model the environment in a user-friendly way; the latter is then compiled to trace expressions for both static formal verification and runtime verification. To evaluate our approach, we apply it to two different case studies: an autonomous cruise control system and a simulation of the Mars Curiosity rover.},

abstract="The design of autonomous vehicles includes obstacle detection and avoidance, route planning, speed control, etc. However, there is a lack of an explicitely representation of the rules of the road on an autonomous vehicle. Additionally, it is necessary to understand the behaviour of an autonomous vehicle in order to check whether or not it works according to the rules of the road. Here, we propose an agent-based architecture to embed the rules of the road into an agent representing the behaviour of an autonomous vehicle. We use temporal logic to formally represent the rules of the road in a way it should be possible to capture when and how a given rule of the road can be applied. Our contributions include: i. suggestion of changes in the rules of the road; ii. representation of rules in a suitable way for an autonomous vehicle agent; iii. dealing with indeterminate terms in the Highway Code.",

	Abstract = {Considering the popular framing of an artificial intelligence as a rational agent that always seeks to maximise its expected utility, referred to as its goal, one of the features attributed to such rational agents is that they will never select an action which will change their goal. Therefore, if such an agent is to be friendly towards humanity, one argument goes, we must understand how to specify this friendliness in terms of a utility function. Wolfhart Totschnig (Fully Autonomous AI, Science and Engineering Ethics, 2020), argues in contrast that a fully autonomous agent will have the ability to change its utility function and will do so guided by its values. This commentary examines computational accounts of goals, values and decision-making. It rejects the idea that a rational agent will never select an action that changes its goal but also argues that an artificial intelligence is unlikely to be purely rational in terms of always acting to maximise a utility function. It nevertheless also challenges the idea that an agent which does not change its goal cannot be considered fully autonomous. It does agree that values are an important component of decision-making and explores a number of reasons why.},

abstract="Autonomy has been one of the most desirable features for robotic applications in recent years. This is evidenced by a recent surge of research in autonomous driving cars, strong government funding for research in robotics for extreme environments, and overall progress in service robots. Autonomous decision-making is often at the core of these systems, thus, it is important to be able to verify and validate properties that relate to the correct behaviour that is expected of the system. Our main contribution in this paper, is an interface for integrating BDI-based agents into robotic systems developed using ROS. We use the Gwendolen language to program our BDI agents and to make use of the AJPF model checker in order to verify properties related to the decision-making in the agent programs. Our case studies include 3D simulations using a simple autonomous patrolling behaviour of a TurtleBot, and multiple TurtleBots servicing a house that can cooperate with each other in case of failure.",

abstract="The Curiosity rover is one of the most complex systems successfully deployed in a planetary exploration mission to date. It was sent by NASA to explore the surface of Mars and to identify potential signs of life. Even though it has limited autonomy on-board, most of its decisions are made by the ground control team. This hinders the speed at which the Curiosity reacts to its environment, due to the communication delays between Earth and Mars. Depending on the orbital position of both planets, it can take 4--24 min for a message to be transmitted between Earth and Mars. If the Curiosity were controlled autonomously, it would be able to perform its activities much faster and more flexibly. However, one of the major barriers to increased use of autonomy in such scenarios is the lack of assurances that the autonomous behaviour will work as expected. In this paper, we use a Robot Operating System (ROS) model of the Curiosity that is simulated in Gazebo and add an autonomous agent that is responsible for high-level decision-making. Then, we use a mixture of formal and non-formal techniques to verify the distinct system components (ROS nodes). This use of heterogeneous verification techniques is essential to provide guarantees about the nodes at different abstraction levels, and allows us to bring together relevant verification evidence to provide overall assurance.",

abstract="The use of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) on our streets is soon to be a reality; increasingly, interacting with such AVs will be part of our daily routine. However, we will certainly need to assure the reliable behaviour of an AV, especially when some unexpected scenarios (e.g. harsh environments, obstacles, emergencies) are taken into account. In this article we use an intelligent agent approach to capture the high-level decision-making process within an AV and then use formal verification techniques to automatically, and strongly, analyse the required behaviours. Specifically, we use the MCAPL framework, wherein our core agent is implemented using the GWENDOLEN agent programming language, and to which we can apply model checking via the AJPF model checker. By performing such formal verification on our agent, we are able to prove that the AV's decision-making process, embedded within the GWENDOLEN agent plans, matches our requirements. As examples, we will verify (formal) properties in order to determine whether the agent behaves in a reliable manner through three different levels of emergency displayed in a simple urban traffic environment.",

abstract="Autonomous robotic systems such as Connected and Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) systems are both safety-and security-critical, since a breach in system security may impact safety. Generally, safety and security concerns for such systems are treated separately during the development process. In this paper, we consider an algorithm for sending Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs) between vehicles in a CAV system and the use of CAMs in preventing vehicle collisions. We employ threat analysis techniques that are commonly used in the cyber security domain to guide our formal verification. This allows us to focus our formal methods on those security properties that are particularly important and to consider both safety and security in tandem. Our analysis centres on identifying STRIDE security properties and we illustrate how these can be formalised, and subsequently verified, using a combination of formal tools for distinct aspects, namely Promela/SPIN and Dafny.",

abstract="The issue of explainability for autonomous systems is becoming increasingly prominent. Several researchers and organisations have advocated the provision of a ``Why did you do that?'' button which allows a user to interrogate a robot about its choices and actions. We take previous work on debugging cognitive agent programs and apply it to the question of supplying explanations to end users in the form of answers to why-questions. These previous approaches are based on the generation of a trace of events in the execution of the program and then answering why-questions using the trace. We implemented this framework in the agent infrastructure layer and, in particular, the Gwendolen programming language it supports -- extending it in the process to handle the generation of applicable plans and multiple intentions. In order to make the answers to why-questions comprehensible to end users we advocate a two step process in which first a representation of an explanation is created and this is subsequently converted into natural language in a way which abstracts away from some events in the trace and employs application specific predicate dictionaries in order to translate the first-order logic presentation of concepts within the cognitive agent program in natural language. A prototype implementation of these ideas is provided.",

abstract="One of the major advantages of modular architectures in robotic systems is the ability to add or replace nodes, without needing to rearrange the whole system. In this type of system, autonomous agents can aid in the decision making and high-level control of the robot. For example, a robot may have a module for each of the effectors and sensors that it has and an agent with a plan library containing high-level plans to aid in the decision making within these modules. However, when autonomously replacing a node it can be difficult to reconfigure plans in the agent's plan library while retaining correctness. In this paper, we exploit the formal concept of capabilities in Belief-Desire-Intention agents and describe how agents can reason about these capabilities in order to reconfigure their plan library while retaining overall correctness constraints. To validate our approach, we show the implementation of our framework and an experiment using a practical example in the Mars rover scenario.",
